        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm JAKE COLEMAN, a soon to be business accounting major and proud member of the Delta Chi fraternity. With hands-on experience helping manage my father's companies, I've developed a strong passion for entrepreneurship and a deep understanding of business operations. Throughout my academic journey, I've excelled in my classes, consistently earning stellar grades and recognition from my teachers. Mastering statistics and basic math, I've honed my skills in numbers and analysis. Growing up, I actively participated in various aspects of my father's businesses.<br><br>

        From overseeing financial transactions to analyzing budgets, I gained practical experience that gave me valuable insights into the complexities of running successful enterprises. This firsthand experience has fueled my entrepreneurial spirit and equipped me with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by business owners. As a member of the Delta Chi fraternity, I've held several leadership positions, holding the Dale Carnegie Scholar Position. In this role, I successfully learned proper leadership skills I could take into my fraternity and daily life. Through my involvement, I've developed strong organizational and decision-making skills while fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment within our fraternity. My passion for accounting and entrepreneurship drives my aspirations to pursue a financial management and advisory services career. I'm dedicated to utilizing my skills and experiences to help businesses thrive and make informed financial decisions.<br><br>

        With a proven track record of academic excellence, practical business experience, and leadership within Delta Chi, I am a motivated and ambitious individual ready to make a significant impact in accounting and beyond. I continue to want to push to create my own company like my dad has successfully done. I continue to work towards this passion and future as I look for an internship to achieve this goal. WIth hard work and determination, I know I will be able to achieve these goals. Outside the fraternity, I have been a member of modeled united nations, a debate speaking class that has allowed me to learn how to communicate and speak well with others. Back in Highschool, I was the wrestling team captain of a very successful wrestling team with around a 100-person roster. With these leadership skills, I can enter the field of accounting and have the ability to make correct decisions under pressure. Always pushing for better, I will continue to push to improve myself daily. I also take great pride in my attention to detail. This plays an important role in being a successful accountant, with few to no errors allowed. Always fascinated by money and keeping track of money, I think this career perfectly fits me. As I want to make a positive impact on others, I can do so by playing a crucial role in the success of businesses and organizations. Providing essential financial information that drives decision-making, aiding in resource allocation, and helping identify growth opportunities. By ensuring accurate financial records and offering strategic financial insights, accountants contribute to their clients' or employers' financial stability and growth.
